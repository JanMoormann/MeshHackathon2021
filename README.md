# Slogan der Solution

Reduce emissions with green mobility


# Kurzbeschreibung der Solution und Präsentation mit den Schlüsselbotschaften
The target of our app is to encourage the citizens to reduce the co2 emissions, without losing their mobility.
Our target group is primarily the environmentally conscious people.
Of course, we also try to bring people closer to the topic with the app, who have not given much thought to it, what harms the environment and how much.

The main function of our app is, to show our users, how they can reach their destination and how much co2 will emit.
When the co2-level in your city increase, the ticketprices are going down.
If you choose to emit less co2 with taking the bus for example, you will get credits directly in your profile.
Tickets can be bought directly in the app.

The possibility with the least co2 emission, will give you the most credits.
Credits can be used as coupon for your next purchase

The in-app dashboard shows your ranking in your city and the change per day.

Achievements will be rewarded with trophies.

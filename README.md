# What is the title of our solution?
The title of our solution is "GoGreen-App"


# Slogan der Solution
ANIMATE FRIENDS AND FAMILY,
reduce emissions with green mobility


# Kurzbeschreibung der Solution und Präsentation mit den Schlüsselbotschaften
The target of our app is to encourage the citizens to reduce the co2 emissions, without losing their mobility.
Our target group is primarily the environmentally conscious people.
Of course, we also try to bring people closer to the topic with the app, who have not given much thought to it, what harms the environment and how much.

The main function of our app is, to show our users, how they can reach their destination and how much co2 will be saved in comparison to using a car.

If you choose to emit less co2 with taking the bus for example, you will get credits directly in your profile.
The possibility with the least co2 emission, will give you the most credits.
When the co2-level in your city reaches a specific level, you will earn more credits for using public transportation, riding a bike or walking instead.
This would lead to less people driving and more people using public transport.
Tickets can be bought directly in the app.

Credits can be used as coupon for your next purchase or you can donate them to environmental non-profit organizations aswell.

The in-app dashboard shows your ranking in your city and your development of the last weeks.

Achievements will be rewarded with trophies.
